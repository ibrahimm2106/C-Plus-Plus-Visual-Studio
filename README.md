I have been assigned the task of developing a library management system for Stepwise University, which will cater to both students and librarians, each with specific privileges. The system will facilitate several key functions: registering books, borrowing and returning books, and calculating fines. Librarians will be responsible for registering books by entering details such as BookID, Title, Authors, Year, Publisher, Number of Books, Number of Currently Available Books, and Relevant Subjects into a CSV file. Both students and librarians will have the ability to borrow books, provided there are available copies, and each book can be borrowed for up to two weeks. I will ensure that borrowing and return details are recorded in separate files, and if books are returned late, a fine of 20P per day will be calculated and documented in another file. The system must include exception handling, follow object-oriented programming principles, and validate inputs. I will develop the system in C++ using only the standard library and ensure it is compatible with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio compiler. Additionally, I will provide thorough documentation for the code. I have made two files one in which is only a library system and another file incorporating a student menu in which can allow the user to switch through the different options in the code.
